The files in this repository were created from the data analyzed and presented in our manuscript entitled
"How Cultural Meanings of Occupations in the U.S. Changed with the Covid-19 Pandemic." My co-authors are
Lynn Smith-Lovin, Robert E. Freeland, Jesse Hoey, and Kimberly B. Rogers. Our manuscript was accepted for 
publication by American Behavioral Scientist in April 2021. To request a copy of the manuscript before it
appears in print, please contact me at joseph.quinn@duke.edu.

Two groups of files appear in this repository. The first is a set of tables and figures with character
identifiers (e.g., FigA). These are supplementary analyses that we reference in footnotes of the piece. 
The second is a single file containing a version of all of the tables and figures from the accepted version
of our paper.
